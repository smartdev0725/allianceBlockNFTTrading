**Reputation** is a key sub-system that permeates the whole P2P protocol. **Reputation** is represented by the [rALBT token](Glossary.md). Users can earn **rALBT** depending on the [Tier](Glossary.md) they picked prior to investing and any action they take will earn a certain amount of tokens:

* Signing messages
* upvoting projects
* downvoting projects
* sharing projects
* broadcasting messages on-chain (paying gas fees)

Aditionally, when a user has **10k rALBT**, they are entitled to claim an [Investment Ticket](Glossary.md) that will automatically win them a chance at the next [Ticket Raffle](Glossary.md)

In short, **rALBT** increases your chances of earning an investment opportunity. The more you participate, the better chances you'll have.

There are two major protections implemented:
1) At launch, the `transfer()` functionalities within the [rALBT token](Glossary.md) will be locked, to protect the protocol from whales.
2) The relation between the amount of *rALBT* and the benefits within the platform are equalized by the [GEV Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution). This discourages hoarding *rALBT*, because after certain point it won't have any considerable effect.

## Reputation markets
After a grace period has passed and the *Reputation tokens* have converged to a stable system, the [DAO](DAO.md) will enable the `transfer()` of *rALBT*. This will open up the possibilities to trading **Reputation Tokens**. Because of the **GEV Distribution**
