# How projects get financed

## Project investment

A project that needs funding will seek for investors. We call this project a [Seeker](Glossary.md). The **Seeker** will have to go through several stages in order to receive funding.

1. Request stage: Seeker will [Request Investment](Glossary.md). This request consist of several parts
    * [Hard data](Glossary.md) regarding the project.
    * A general Project Description.
    * Token sale, previously generated by the **Seeker** on a [TGE](Glossary.md).

2. Review stage: The [DAO](DAO.md) will review the **Seeker's request** and decide whether to approve the project for investment or not.
    * If the DAO decides not to approve, the **Seeker** will receive a notification and they will be able to claim back their [project tokens](Glossary.md).
    * If the DAO decides that the project is worth investing in, the **Seeker** will be notified and a [Funding Stage](Glossary.md) begins.
3. Listing stage: At the start of the funding process, the Project will become [listed](Glossary.md) on the website. Potential [Funders](Glossary.md) will receive a notification via e-mail, encouraging them to sign-in to their accounts and [Subscribing](Glossary.md) to the project.
4. Subscribing stage: **Funders** subscribe to a project for a chance at winning a [Founder Ticket](Glossary.md). Subscribing is a declaration of intent to invest a certain amount of assets (generally USDT/USDC/DAI) in a specific project.
5. Ticket stage: Once the subscription (*declaration of intent by the potential funders*) has concluded, the **DAO** emmits the tickets and distributes them according to the tiers:
    * Tier 0 receives 1% of the tickets: users who have declared intent but have no ALBT staked.
    * Tier 1 receives 5% of the tickets: users who have declared intent but have 5k ALBT staked
    * Tier 2 receives 10% of the tickets: users who have declared intent but have 50k ALBT staked
    * Tier 3 receives 5% of the tickets: users who have declared intent but have 200k ALBT staked.

**Note: within each tier there is a *first-come first-served* distribution of the tickets.**

6. Funding stage: When a potential funder receives their [Funder ticket](Glossary.md), they are encouraged to make a payment for at least the total amount they declared in the previous phase. If they do so, they receive a [Funding NFT](Glossary.md), representing their investment in the project.
7. Claiming stage: After the project goals have been reached and all of the **Funders** have purchased their **Funding NFT**, the **Funding Stage** is closed. **Funders** are now able to claim the **Project tokens** and Seekers are able to claim their project funding from the [Escrow](Glossary.md)
