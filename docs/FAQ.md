## How convertible notes works?
Convertible notes are originally structured as debt investments but have a provision that allows the principal plus accrued interest to convert into an equity investment at a later date. 
* Are essentially a hybrid of debt and equity 
* Are debt instruments that include terms like a maturity date, an interest rate
* Will convert into equity if a future equity round is raised
Convertible Note Economics

## Discount Rate
Convertible notes are set up to convert to preferred stock at the next equity round at a "discount". This rewards early stage investors for taking more risk than the later investors. A typical conversion discount is 20%.

## Valuation Cap
Maximum valuation allowed for the startup for the purpose of conversion to preferred stock, regardless of what the valuation of the startup is at the time of the next priced equity round. This protects the early investors by making sure they retain a reasonable percentage of ownership even if the startup becomes much more valuable later on.

## Interest rate
The interest is not paid out but accrued until the first priced round, at which point the interest is converted to shares the same like the principal for the loan.

## Maturity date
This denotes the date on which the note is due, at which time the company needs to repay it.

## Amount
Denotes how much money will be lended.

## Closing date
Date on which the money will be provided to the startup/entrepreneur.

## Conversion
Describes when and how the loan amount converts into ownership (shares)

* Automatic: When in the future, when there is an “equity round” where investors prevalue the startup, which determines the value of the share. Investors are buying stock in the company to make an investment

* Optional:  Occurs when the loan has reached the maturity and there was no equity investment 


## What Happens If the Maturity Date is reached prior to raising money in equity round?

## Investor can call a loan
Investor can demand loan repayment, however since the startup was not able to raise equity, investor would not receive cash back, or will receive only worthless fraction of the investment. 

## Extend the maturity date
Investors can agree to extend the maturity date and continue on accruing interest. This gives a startup time for growth and possibility to receive financing.

## Enter into the repayment schedule
Startup will repay the notes in tranches over an agreed period of time. By paying the loan in tranches, the company can repay the loan without going out of business. 
What mechanism should be introduced in case of product not delivering - solution proposal

## AllianceBlock decentralized app can provide funding for projects that:
1. Will conduct Token Generation Event along with funding process via AllianceBlock
2. Project already has a Token and is seeking to find liquidity. Project is willing to sell a certain part of tokens at a discount in order to receive financing for project growth.

### Process summary

1. Company  that is willing to raise money for its blockchain-based project is required to contact DAO Delegators to agree on the requirements needed to be completed in order to receive funding.
2. Project is required to provide the business plan. Document is setting out a business's future objectives and strategies for achieving them. 
3. DAO Delegators are responsible to provide guidance on how business plans should be structured. DAO is incentivised for every successful funding and every achieved milestones, therefore its in DAO interest to assist Project to deliver the best business plan.
4. Business plan is uploaded together with a Request for funding document into the decentralized application, Maturity Date is populated along with other funding economics to define the time of the repayment.
5. The business plan will contain Maturity Date on which project needs to repay the loan. By that time the project needs to either generate revenue, or can gain funds from token price appreciation in order to repay the lenders.
6. Decision on unlocking next tranches of the funding is based on achieving the pre agreed Milestones by the project. 
7. DAO Delegators are voting if the next tranche will be provided to the project.

### Milestone delivery extension

1. If the project does not achieve the Milestone first time, the Milestone delivery is automatically extended for 2 months. 
2. If the project does not achieve the Milestone second time, DAO is voting if the Milestone delivery period can be extended. Delivery period can be extended unlimited times if DAO decides to extend the funding.
3. If due to some reason Project will not be able to deliver the Milestone, however there will be a positive traction DAO can still vote to provide the next funding tranche in order to keep the project alive. 

### Project not deliver the Milestones

1. If the project will not deliver pre agreed Milestones and DAO will vote against extension of Milestone delivery, the project can raise a dispute and the dispute resolution process is initiated. 
2. If DAO Jurors decision is negative the project funding is withheld


### Maturity date

1. At Maturity Date, the project needs to repay the loan to the lenders. There are two ways Project can repay the loan:
    * Repay the loan principal plus interest that has accrued over a time
    * Provide to the lenders tokens at discounted price 

### Project is not able to repay the funding

1. If the project is not able to repay the funding at Maturity Date, DAO Delegators are deciding on the future of the project. DAO can decide
    * Call a loan - DAO can demand the repayment from Project, however due to poor project condition lenders could receive small portion of the initial investment and respective amount of tokens deposited ( if TGE happened )
    * Extend the Maturity Date  - DAO can agree to extend the Maturity Date for the project, to give the project additional time to gain traction, and potentially to generate revenue required to repay the loan. Additional interests are accrued and charged at the new maturity date. 
    * Loan reschedule - DAO can agree to restructure the loan repayment. Instead of paying one sum at maturity, the repayment is divided into smaller parts to be repaid over the time. Lenders receive additional interest rated accrued over the time 
2. If the project is still not able to repay the funding after extending the Maturity Date or Loan rescheduling, DAO triggers the liquidation process

Assuming Legal framework is in place and the agreement with Project makes it eligible to recover funds via bankruptcy process

### Liquidation process due to project failure

### Project after token generation event

1. When liquidation occurs, the All tokens deposited in the escrow are sold via integrated decentralized exchanges and the profit is accordingly redistributed between the lenders.
2. Any money left at the company is being accordingly redistributed between the lenders.
3. The ownership of the physical assets are granted to the lenders in form of NFT tokens that represents the real world assets
