# Test Scenarios

These tests are made thinking on possible scenarios we will see in the usage of this app.

## Usage
To run these tests you can use the `testScenario.js` script.

```bash
# Run all the scenarios
yarn test:scenario all

# Run only scenarios for a project type
yarn run test:scenario investment

# Run only a scenario
yarn run test:scenario investment happyPath
```

These scenarios also run when you use `yarn test`
