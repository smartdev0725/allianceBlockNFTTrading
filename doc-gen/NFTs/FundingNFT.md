Burns tokens




### `_increaseGenerations(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint256 amount, uint256 generationsToAdd)` (internal)

increase multiple generations of a token


token is burned, and new token is minted to user
token owner should have approvedForAll before calling this function


### `_decreaseGenerations(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint256 amount, uint256 generationsToDecrease)` (internal)

decrease multiple generations of a token


token is burned, and new token is minted to user
token owner should have approvedForAll before calling this function


### `_beforeTokenTransfer(address operator, address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)` (internal)

Runs checks before transferring a token
